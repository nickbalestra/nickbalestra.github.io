##[Cactus](http://cactusformac.com/) is a fast, easy and free static site generator, kinda like Jekyll but made to run on your mac. It features a good, simple and modern template. I really like Cactus default simple theme and I wanted to port it to Jekyll. The result is [Kactus](https://github.com/nickbalestra/kactus).
